# Number_recognition_app
A simple web app for recognitiing written digits via a non convolutional neural Network(only L2 regularized).
The future of the project is oriented toward:
-bug fixing the back end server
-security improvement
-implementing without any library more sophisticated technic to the neural network  such has
  momentum SGD
  convolution
  dropping technic
  meta parameter optimization
